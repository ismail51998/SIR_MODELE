# SIR_MODELE
We wish to apply some numerical methods seen in progress to simulate the spread over time of an epidemic (the coronavirus for example) within a given population. We use the model, called SIR, which assumes that the population is divided into 3 compartments :
—S: individuals Healthy or Likely to be infected. 
— I: those who are Infected. 
— R: those who have recovered

where β> 0 denotes the incidence rate, λ is the number of days on average during which an individual remains ill and μ is a parameter whose value is proportional to the virulence of the contaminating agent. 
add initial conditions S(0)=S0,I(0)=I0,R(0)=R0. It is assumed here that R0 = 0, which expresses the fact that no individual is immune at the start of the infection period.
